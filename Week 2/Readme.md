# Week 2: Exploring Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming in Python 🐍

Welcome to Week 2! 🎉 This week, we're going to dive even deeper into Python and explore some of its powerful data structures. By the end of this week, you'll be well on your way to becoming an intermediate Python programmer. Let's get started! 🚀

## This Week's Topics

### 0. [Loops and Conditional Statements](../Week%202/0.%20Loops%20and%20Conditional%20Statements/) 🔄
- **For Loops**: Understanding the basic syntax and use cases.
- **While Loops**: Learning how to use while loops effectively.
- **Conditional Statements**: If, elif, and else statements.
- **Nested Loops and Conditionals**: Combining loops and conditionals for more complex logic.
- **Combined Practices**: Combiing the practices taht we have learned today and putting them into real world practice.

### 1. [Lists](../Week%202/1.%20Lists/) 📋
- **Introduction to Lists**: Understanding list creation, indexing, and slicing.
- **List Methods**: Learn common methods such as `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, and `reverse()`.
- **List Comprehensions**: Simplifying loops and creating lists in a more readable way.
- **Nested Lists**: Working with lists within lists and accessing nested data.

### 2. [Dictionaries](../Week%202/2.%20Dictionaries/) 📚
- **Introduction to Dictionaries**: Creating dictionaries and understanding key-value pairs.
- **Dictionary Methods**: Using methods like `get()`, `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `update()`, and `pop()`.
- **Looping Through Dictionaries**: Iterating over keys, values, and items.
- **Nested Dictionaries**: Handling dictionaries within dictionaries for more complex data structures.

### 3. [Tuples, Sets, and Frozensets](../Week%202/3.%20Tuples%20Sets%20and%20Frozensets/) 🔗
- **Tuples**:
  - Creating and using tuples.
  - Tuple methods and immutability.
  - When to use tuples vs. lists.
- **Sets**:
  - Creating and using sets.
  - Set operations: union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
  - Set methods: `add()`, `remove()`, `discard()`, `pop()`.
- **Frozensets**:
  - Understanding frozensets and their immutability.
  - Practical uses of frozensets.

### 4. [Object-Oriented Programming](../Week%202/4.%20Object%20Oriented%20Programming/) 🧩
- **Introduction to OOP**: Understanding the basics of object-oriented programming and its benefits.
- **Classes and Objects**:
  - Defining a class and creating objects.
  - Attributes and methods.
  - The `__init__` method.
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding the internal state of objects and using getter and setter methods.
- **Inheritance**: Creating subclasses and inheriting from parent classes.
  - Method overriding.
  - Using the `super()` function.
- **Polymorphism**: Understanding method overloading and overriding.
- **Special Methods**:
  - Using special methods (dunder methods) like `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, etc.
  - Creating custom special methods for your classes.
- **Composition vs. Inheritance**: When to use composition over inheritance and vice versa.

### 5. [Further Reading](../Week%202/5.%20Further%20Reading/) 📚
- We have added an additional folder that contains notes that we think are important to your development as a Python programmer.

### 6. [Code Challenge](../Week%202/6.%20Code%20Challenge/) 🏆
- Test your skills and apply what you've learned!

Feel free to ask questions and explore each topic thoroughly. Happy coding! 💻😃
