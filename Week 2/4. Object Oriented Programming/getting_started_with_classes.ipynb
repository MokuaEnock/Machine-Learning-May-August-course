    "## An Introduction to Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented programming is a widely used concept to write powerful applications. As a data scientist, you will be required to write applications to process your data, among a range of other things. In this tutorial, you will discover the basics of object-oriented programming in Python. You will learn the following:\n",

    "## OOP Introductionn\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has some advantages over other design patterns. Development is faster and cheaper, with better software maintainability. This, in turn, leads to higher-quality software, which is also extensible with new methods and attributes. The learning curve is, however, steeper. The concept may be too complex for beginners. Computationally, OOP software is slower, and uses more memory since more lines of code have to be written.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is based on the imperative programming paradigm, which uses statements to change a program's state. It focuses on describing how a program should operate. Examples of imperative programming languages are C, C++, Java, Go, Ruby and Python. This stands in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the computer program should accomplish, without specifying how. Examples are database query languages like SQL and XQuery, where one only tells the computer what data to query from where, but now how to do it.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "OOP uses the concept of objects and classes. A class can be thought of as a 'blueprint' for objects. These can have their own attributes (characteristics they possess), and methods (actions they perfo\n",
    "\n",
    "## OOP Example\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a class is the class `Dog`. Don't think of it as a specific dog, or your own dog. We're describing what a dog is and can do, in general. Dogs usually have a `name` and `age`; these are instance attributes. Dogs can also `bark`; this is a method.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "When you talk about a specific dog, you would have an object in programming: an object is an instantiation of a class. This is the basic principle on which object-oriented programming is based. So my dog Ozzy, for example, belongs to the clas`s D`og. His attributes ar`e name = 'Ozz`y' an`d age = '`2'. A different dog will have different attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to create a class\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a class in Python, you can use the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, an `__init__` method has to be defined with `def`. This is the initializer that you can later use to instantiate objects. It's similar to a constructor in Java. `__init__` must always be present! It takes one argument: `self`, which refers to the object itself. Inside the method, the `pass` keyword is used as of now, because Python expects you to type something there. Remember to use correct indentation!s.rm).ance\n"

It takes `self`, as per usual, and buddy as arguments. In this case, `buddy` will be another Dog object. Set the `self.buddy` attribute to buddy, and the `buddy.buddy` attribute to `self`. This means that the relationship is reciprocal; you are your buddy's buddy. In this case, Filou will be Ozzy's buddy, which means that Ozzy automatically becomes Filou's buddy.

    "\r\n",
    "In Python object-oriented programming, inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit properties from another class. The class that derives properties is called the derived class or child class, and the class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class. The benefits of inheritance are:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- It represents real-world relationships well.\r\n",
    "- It provides reusability of code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\r\n",
    "- It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Types of Inheritance\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance**: Single-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit characteristics from a single parent class.\r\n",
    "2. **Multilevel Inheritance**: Multi-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from an immediate parent class, which in turn inherits properties from its parent class.\r\n",
    "3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Hierarchical inheritance enables more than one derived class to inherit properties from a parent class.\r\n",
    "4. **Multiple Inheritance**: Multiple inheritance enables one derived class to inherit properties from more than one base class.\r\n",
