# 🌟 Feature Transformation Guide 🌟

Welcome to the **Feature Transformation** lesson! This guide will help you understand various techniques used to transform data features, making them more suitable for machine learning models. Whether you're working with time-series data, categorical variables, or numerical features, this lesson has got you covered.

## What to Expect

In this lesson, you'll explore different methods of feature transformation. Each section includes interactive notebooks for a hands-on experience. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid understanding of how to preprocess and transform your data effectively.

## Table of Contents

### 1. ⏰ Time-Series Transformations

- **Lag**: Introduce lagged features to your time-series data. 📊
- **Moving Average**: Smooth your time-series data with moving averages. 📈
- **Weekly Resampled Aggregation**: Aggregate your data on a weekly basis. 📅
- **Weekly Rolling Aggregation**: Apply rolling aggregation on a weekly basis. 🔄
- **Velocity and Acceleration**: Calculate the velocity and acceleration from your data. 🏎️💨
- **Energy**: Compute the energy of your time-series data. ⚡
- **Mean Difference**: Calculate the mean difference in your data. 📐
- **Mean Absolute Difference**: Compute the mean absolute difference. 📏
